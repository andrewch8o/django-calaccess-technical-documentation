Models for tracking updates
===========================

The raw-data app also keeps track of each version of the CAL-ACCESS database released by the California Secretary of State, including its release date and byte size, as well as the activity of the `management commands <http://django-calaccess-raw-data.californiacivicdata.org/en/latest/managementcommands.html>`_ that process this data.

This tracking information is stored in the data tables outlined below.

.. note::

    By default, the raw-data app does *not* archive previous versions of the CAL-ACCESS database. Rather, with each call to the management commands, the data files they process are overwritten by new versions.

    You can configure the raw-data app to keep each version of the zip file downloaded from the California Secretary of State as well as the indivdual raw .csv files and cleaned .tsv files by flipping the ``CALACCESS_STORE_ARCHIVE`` to ``True`` in ``settings.py``:

    .. code-block:: python

        # in settings.py
        CALACCESS_STORE_ARCHIVE = True

    The older versions of these files then be saved to the path specified by your Django project's ``MEDIA_ROOT`` setting (more on that `here <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/settings/#media-root>`_).
