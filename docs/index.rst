Django CAL-ACCESS documentation
===============================

Technical documentation for a collection of applications that make it easier to work with `CAL-ACCESS <http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/>`_,
the jumbled, dirty and difficult government database that tracks campaign finance and lobbying activity
in California politics. Built using the `Django web framework <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_.

This is an active work-in-progress. It is developed and maintained by the `California Civic Data Coalition <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/about/>`_,
a open-source team of journalists and computer programmers from news organizations across America.
