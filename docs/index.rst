Overview
--------

* A grant-funded open civic data project
* Pipeline to download, extract, load, clean, transform and republish
* Developed in Python's popular Django framework
* Authored by a coalition of journalists, academics and researchers
* Open source, community-driven project
* This is a work in progress

Why?
----

* The CAL-ACCESS database contains important public interest data about who is backing and influencing state and local in California
* Journalists have used this data for important watchdog reporting (links to articles)
* We want to enable more of this kind of reporting by doing the boring work out in the open where others can see what we are doing and contribute
