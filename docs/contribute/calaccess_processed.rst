Contribute to django-calaccess-processed-data
=============================================

This walkthrough is for developers who want to contribute to :doc:`/apps/calaccess_processed`, a Django app to transform and refine campaign-finance and lobbying-activity data from the California Secretary of Stateâ€™s CAL-ACCESS database.

It will show you how to install the source code of this application to fix bugs and develop new features.

---------------


Preparing a development environment
-----------------------------------

It is not required, but it is recommended that development of the library be done from within a contained virtual environment.

One way to accomplish that is with Python's ``virtualenv`` tool and its helpful companion ``virtualenvwrapper``. If you have that installed, a new project can be started with the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkproject django-calaccess-processed-data

That will jump into a new folder in your code directory, where you can clone our code repository from GitHub_ after you make a fork of your own. Don't know what that means? `Read this`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/django-calaccess-processed-data.git .

Next install the other Python libraries our code depends on.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

---------------


Connecting to a local database
------------------------------

Unlike a typical Django project, this application only supports PostgreSQL version 9.6 and above as a database backend. This is because we enlist specialized tools to load the immense amount of source data. We haven't developed those routines for SQLite and the other Django backends yet, but we might someday.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create the database the PostgreSQL way.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ createdb calaccess_processed -U postgres

Create a file at ``example/project/settings_local.py`` to save your custom database credentials. That might look something like this.

.. code-block:: python

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'NAME': 'calaccess_processed',
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
            'USER': 'username', # <-- Change this
            'PASSWORD': 'password', # <-- And this
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '5432'
        }
    }

.. note::

    If you'd prefer to load the CAL-ACCESS outside your default database, check out our guide to working with Django's system for `multiple databases`_.

---------------


Once the database is configured
-------------------------------

Now create the tables and get to work.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python example/manage.py migrate

Once everything is set up, the updatecalaccessrawdata_ command will download the latest
bulk data release from `the Secretary of State's website <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/cal-access-resources/raw-data-campaign-finance-and-lobbying-activity/>`_ and load it into your local database.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python example/manage.py updatecalaccessrawdata

.. warning::

    This will take a while. Go grab some coffee.

Because the nightly raw export is incomplete, we have to scrape additional data from the `CAL-ACCESS website`_. Use the scrapecalaccess_ command to kick off this process, either after ``updatecalaccessrawdata`` finishes or in a separate terminal window:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ python example/manage.py scrapecalaccess

Once the raw CAL-ACCESS data is loaded and the scrape has finished, you can transform all this messy data you've collected into our easy-to-understand, well-documented models with the processcalaccessdata_ command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python example/manage.py processcalaccessdata

Welcome aboard!

Now that your development environment is set up, check out the `GitHub issue tracker`_ where plenty of work awaits.

As you submit your work, please pay attention to the results of our `integration tests`_ (more details :doc:`here </contribute/testing>`).
