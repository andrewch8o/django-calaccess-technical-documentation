The CAL-ACCESS database
=======================

This section includes resources that describe the inner-workings of the CAL-ACCESS,
the California state government database for collecting, storing and reporting
campaign-finance and lobbying-activity information.

CAL-ACCESS is maintained by the California Secretary of State. In addition to the
(clunky and crash-prone) `website <http://dbsearch.ss.ca.gov/>`_ for searching and exploring this data,
the Secretary of State's website also `publishes nightly exports <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/cal-access-resources/raw-data-campaign-finance-and-lobbying-activity/>`_
from the CAL-ACCESS database.

These exports are the source data of this project.
