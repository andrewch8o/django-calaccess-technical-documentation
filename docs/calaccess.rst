The CAL-ACCESS database
=======================

`CAL-ACCESS <http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/>`_ is the jumbled, dirty and difficult government database that tracks campaign finance and lobbying activity
in California politics.

It is maintained by California's Secretary of State. In addition to the
`website <http://dbsearch.ss.ca.gov/>`_ for searching and exploring these data,
a bulk download is `updated nightly <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/cal-access-resourcesraw-data-campaign-finance-and-lobbying-activity/>`_.

That bulk download, documented here, is the source data of this project.
