Filing forms
============

The data in CAL-ACCESS originates from forms filed by public office candidates, campaign committees, lobbyists and lobbyist employers. These filing forms are outlined below.

Much of the documents and descriptions included here were gathered from the `Forms <http://www.fppc.ca.gov/forms.html>`_ section of the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) website, where you can find even more detailed filing instructions and requirements.

Similar documentation and background info can also be found in the `Campaign Finance <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/campaign-disclosure-and-requirements>`_ and `Lobbying Activities <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/lobbying-disclosure-requirements>`_ sections of the California Secretary of State's website.
