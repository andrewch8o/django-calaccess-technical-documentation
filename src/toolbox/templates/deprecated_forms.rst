Some of the data in this :doc:`CAL-ACCESS database </calaccess/dbtables>` were collected on these {{ form_count }}
filing forms that have since been deprecated by the California Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC).

No information about these forms is available on either the `FPPC's website <http://www.fppc.ca.gov/forms.html>`_ or the
California Secretary of State's website (in the `Campaign Forms <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/campaign-disclosure-and-requirements/campaign-forms-and-instructions/>`_ or `Lobbying Forms <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/lobbying-disclosure-requirements/lobbying-forms-instructions/>`_ sections).

What we know about these documents, including which forms supposedly replaced them,
was gathered in interviews with staff members at the FPPC.
