California's Political Reform Act requires that political candidates and campaign committees disclose their contributions and expenditures by filing the forms outlined below. The data collected on these {{ form_count }} forms are stored in the CAL-ACCESS database. Where possible, we have also mapped each form to the specific database tables.

You can read more about these forms and the disclosure requirements in the `Campaign Forms <http://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/campaign-rules/campaign-forms.html>`_ and `Campaign Disclosure Manuals <http://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/campaign-rules/campaign-disclosure-manuals.html>`_ sections of the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) website as well as the `Campaign Forms and Instructions <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/campaign-disclosure-and-requirements/campaign-forms-and-instructions/>`_ and `Campaign Filing Requirements <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/campaign-disclosure-and-requirements/campaign-filing-requirements/>`_ sections of the California Secretary of State's website.
