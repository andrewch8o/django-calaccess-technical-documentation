California's Political Reform Act requires individuals, business and other organizations that lobby public officials to file registration statements and periodic reports disclosing their activities, employers and expenditures. The data collected on these {{ form_count }} forms are stored in the CAL-ACCESS database.

You can read more about these forms and the disclosure requirements in the `Lobbying Manual and Forms <http://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/lobbyist-rules/lobbying-manual-and-forms.html>`_ section of the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) website as well as the `Lobbying Forms and Instructions <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/lobbying-disclosure-requirements/lobbying-forms-instructions/>`_ and `Lobbying Filing Requirements <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/lobbying-disclosure-requirements/lobbying-filing-requirements/>` sections of the California Secretary of State's website.

.. warning::

    The sections and page numbers noted below match those of the current sample forms provided by the FPPC, but not necessarily any of the actual forms submitted by filers. This is a result of filings that include multiple pages for a given schedule as well as changes to the layout of forms over the years.

    You can view a PDF of any form submitted by a filer by pointing your browser at http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/PDFGen/pdfgen.prg?filingid=2028957&amendid=0. Note that in the query string parameters, *2028957* and *0* should be exchanged for the filling id and amendment id of the desired filling.
