California's Political Reform Act requires individuals, business and other organizations that lobby public officials to file registration statements and periodic reports disclosing their activities, employers and expenditures. The data collected on these {{ form_count }} forms are stored in the CAL-ACCESS database. Where possible, we have also mapped each form to the specific database tables.

You can read more about these forms and the disclosure requirements in the `Lobbying Manual and Forms <http://www.fppc.ca.gov/learn/lobbyist-rules/lobbying-manual-and-forms.html>`_ section of the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) website as well as the `Lobbying Forms and Instructions <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/lobbying-disclosure-requirements/lobbying-forms-instructions/>`_ and `Lobbying Filing Requirements <http://www.sos.ca.gov/campaign-lobbying/lobbying-disclosure-requirements/lobbying-filing-requirements/>` sections of the California Secretary of State's website.
