django-calaccess-technical-documentation
========================================

Technical documentation for a collection of applications that make it easier to work with CAL-ACCESS, the jumbled, dirty and difficult government database that tracks campaign-finance and lobbying-activity in California politics. Built using the `Django web framework <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_.

This is a work in progress. It is maintained by the `California Civic Data Coalition <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/about/>`_,
an open-source team of journalists and computer programmers from news organizations across America.
